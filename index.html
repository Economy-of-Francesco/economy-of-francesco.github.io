    <p>The Economy of Francesco is an international movement of young economists, entrepreneurs and change-makers engaged in a process of inclusive dialogue to create a vibrant new economy of today and tomorrow that works for everyone, leaving nobody behind.</p>
    <blockquote>&quot;Today, a new economy inspired by Francis of Assisi can and must become an economy of friendship with the earth and an economy of peace. It is a question of transforming an economy that kills into an economy of life, in all its aspects.&quot; &mdash; Pope Francis</blockquote>
