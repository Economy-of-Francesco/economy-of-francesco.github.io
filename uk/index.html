	<p>On Saturday, 2nd October, young adults from 130 countries around the world are coming together as the Economy of Francesco to build an inclusive and sustainable economy that works for all. Weâ€™re hosting a local event in London â€“ and it is an opportunity to make friends with other young adults to build an economy that is inclusive, human-centred and cares for the environment. We will run a group activity in the morning and participate in the global broadcast from Assisi in the afternoon. The event is open to all, regardless of faith, belief or occupation. Participation is free.</p>

We will apply the concept using the themes of the Economy of Francesco.<br/><br/>The group will be invited to reflect together on finding those forces and synergies to help system change for the better. The outputs of the group activity will be shared with the wider EoF global community in the afternoon.</p>
